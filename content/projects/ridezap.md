short_description: Ridesharing website in order to make moving between cities and sharing the cost of gas easier.
long_description: <p>After spending a year in France, I missed the website <a href="http://www.covoiturage.fr">Covoiturage</a>. This website made it much easier to move between cities and organize rides. I couldn't find a US equivalent at the time, and with my girlfriend living in another city I decided to make my own. This set off a multi-month project where I built RideZap.</p><p>RideZap is written in Ruby on Rails and much of the frontend interaction is handled with the Jquery library.</p>
