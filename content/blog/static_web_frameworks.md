title: Comparing Static Web Frameworks
kind: article
---

Recently I decided to upgrade my personal website to a static website since the all the content I needed was static. In the process I got to look at some of the different static frameworks out there. I thought I would write a short comparison.

###Why static website generator?
Using a static website generator for everyone is not for everyone. If you are running a web application, or dealing with any sort of dynamic content it probably isn't for you.

It is for you if you are running anything where the content is added specifcally by you, or by a group of people. The misconception is in the name. Having a static website generator does not necessarily mean that the website you are building is going to be *static*.  

###The search

My search for the ideal static website framework* started where it ususally does, <%= link_to("Hacker News search", "http://www.hnsearch.com/") %>. After spending a few minutes looking through the <%= link_to("search results", "http://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/02/list-static-website-generators.html") %> I was able to learn of some different types of static web frameworks as well as find out some of the opinions of the knowledgable community.

Eventually my search led to the <%= link_to("nanoc website", "http://nanoc.stoneship.org/") %> where the author left a semi-complete links to a <%= link_to("large number", "http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/1-introduction/#similar-projects") %> of open source static website generators. This really became my home base as I could look at the different options.
