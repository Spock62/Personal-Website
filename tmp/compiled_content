<p>My name is David Petersen. I live in rainy Corvallis Oregon. I enjoy soccer, traveling, and cooking.</p>

<p>I love to dream about traveling, learning, and creating. I was fortunate enough to be able to spend the last year in France traveling and working. The chance to live in Paris for 6 months was truely eye opening for me. I had never been in a city that had a heartbeat of its own. Adjusting to a new culture was a wonderful experience for me. I fell in love with the food, <i>l'art de vivre</i>, and was fortunate to bring back a girlfriend as well.</p>

<p>I have found that web is a means of creative outlet for me. I started learning HTML and CSS several years ago and have just been recently introduced to Ruby on Rails and Django. Both of these frameworks have turned out to be an excellent means of turning ideas quickly into reality. This is what I have found myself to being truely passionate about, being able to find a problem with the world and try to address it using technology. I have began to enjoy working more with Ruby on Rails, but I also work with Django for work. I don't feel tightly bound to one programming language or another, I am somewhat of a language agnostic, even though I do tend to drift toward python for most scripting projects.</p>

<p>This website will serve as a outlet for my portfolio and my thoughs on programming. I am also open to work as a freelancer on your next project.</p>

        <h2>Comparing Static Web Frameworks</h2>
<span>October 24, 2011</span>

      
      <p>Recently I decided to upgrade my personal website to a static website since the all the content I needed was static or could be loaded with javascript. In the process I got to look at some of the different static frameworks out there. I thought I would write a short comparison.</p>

<h3>Why static website generator?</h3>

<p>Using a static website generator is not for everyone. If you are running a web application, or dealing with any sort of dynamic content it probably isn't for you.</p>

<p>It is for you if you are running anything where the content is added specifcally by you, or by a group of people. Most common personal sites or blogs can be run on a static website generator. The misconception is in the name. Having a static website generator does not necessarily mean that the website you are building needs each page to be built by hand. Rather we can create resources and rules and generate static content. Much in the same way a dynamic web framework can.</p>

<h3>The search</h3>

<p>My search for the ideal static website framework started where it ususally does, <a href="http://www.hnsearch.com/">Hacker News search</a>. After spending a few minutes looking through the <a href="http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/all&amp;q=static+web+generator&amp;start=0">search results</a> I was able to learn of some different types of static web frameworks as well as find out some of the opinions of the knowledgable community.</p>

<p>Eventually my search led to the <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc website</a> where the author left a semi-complete links to a <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/1-introduction/#similar-projects">large number</a> of open source static website generators. This really became my home base as I could look at the different options. So now I could look at each static framework one by one.</p>

<h3>The examination</h3>

<p>Now that I have begin to look at some of these frameworks lets dig in to them to see if we can find some differences. I started by looking at Jekyll.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is a popular static web framework written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Warner, the founder of Github. Jekyll uses a sensible set of configuration rules to generate static content. It supports layouts and different types of markup to generate into static html. From the github page it lists: RedCloth, Liquid, Classifier, Maruku, and Pygments all as dependencies. This seems to be the most popular static website generator.</p>

<p>Jekyll works well right out of the box, and does not have a large learning curve to hit the ground running. It is a good system to start with if you are familar and just want to crank something out.</p>

<p>The next ruby library I looked at was <a href="http://stasis.me/">Stasis</a>. Stasis features a number of features. It provides layouts and rendering so you can build your web page in blocks. It uses "Controllers" to pre-process code as well as support for self-written helpers in the code. It was nice to see that Stasis supports <a href="http://stasis.me/#more">so many</a> types of markups, thanks to the excellent <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt">tilt gem</a>.</p>

<p>The last ruby static website generator I looked at was <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a>. Nanoc aims to not have be a framework that you step into and start right off the bat. The goal of this project is to create an excellent foundation for you to shape a static framework how you want. It supports a <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/4-basic-concepts/#filters">large number</a> of markups, called "filters". It makes it easy to write additional filters, so adding support for a different markup is simple. You can even write custom filters for binary data. It also supports layouts and rendering if you want to use generic layouts for a blog or a portfolio. It includes helpers that make blogging easier. The site build revolves around its Rules file, which decides how items are routed and filtered before compilation. This allows you to run certain types of items through multiple filters, and change the way that certain items are compiled. For example static assets can be preprocessed by a minimizer and the outputted to a different directory. By default most items are outputted to a directory that is the same as the filename and renamed to index.html. This enables you to have beautiful URLs by default. It also comes with a few extra nice features that help with pre-deployment and deployment. It supports HTML and CSS validating. Also supports deploy configuartion with Rake.</p>

<p>Next I decided to look at some of the python static website generators.</p>

<p>Probably the most mature and popular Python static web page generator is <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a>. Hyde is uses a some specific tools out of the box: the django templating language, support for sass and scss for your CSS files and support for breadcrumbs/excerpts and pagination. It takes a lot of concepts and configurations directly from Jekyll.</p>

<p>I also decided to look at <a href="https://github.com/mythmon/wok">Wok</a>, a project that my friend <a href="https://github.com/mythmon/">Mike Cooper</a> is working on. He wanted to create an alternative to Hyde, Cyrax, Chisel and  another static web page generator in Python. The main thing missing from these was easy category support which he adds to Wok. Wok uses Jinja2 for templating, YAML for adding attaching data to items. Optionally Wok also supports markdown, docutils and pygments. Other markup support is on the way as well, specifically HAML support.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I finally concluded I wanted to use Nanoc because it appears that it is the most flexible option. In the end though you have to remember that all static web frameworks produce the same thing: HTML. This is not a standard web framework debate where you can argue the merits of one framework being faster or slower than another oen</p>

This allows you to run certain types of items through multiple filters, and change the way that certain items are compiled. For example static assets can be preprocessed by a minimizer and the outputted to a different directory. By default most items are outputted to a directory that is the same as the filename and renamed to index.html. This enables you to have beautiful URLs by default. It also comes with a few extra nice features that help with pre-deployment and deployment. It supports HTML and CSS validating. Also supports deploy configuartion with Rake.

Next I decided to look at some of the python static website generators.

Probably the most mature and popular Python static web page generator is <%= link_to("Hyde", "http://ringce.com/hyde") %>. Hyde is uses a some specific tools out of the box: the django templating language, support for sass and scss for your CSS files and support for breadcrumbs/excerpts and pagination. It takes a lot of concepts and configurations directly from Jekyll.

I also decided to look at <%= link_to("Wok", "https://github.com/mythmon/wok") %>, a project that my friend <%= link_to("Mike Cooper", "https://github.com/mythmon/") %> is working on. He wanted to create an alternative to Hyde, Cyrax, Chisel and  another static web page generator in Python. The main thing missing from these was easy category support which he adds to Wok. Wok uses Jinja2 for templating, YAML for adding attaching data to items. Optionally Wok also supports markdown, docutils and pygments. Other markup support is on the way as well, specifically HAML support. 

###Conclusion

I finally concluded I wanted to use Nanoc because it appears that it is the most flexible option. In the end though you have to remember that all static web frameworks produce the same thing: HTML. This is not a standard web framework debate where you can argue the merits of one framework being faster or slower than another oen;T;
I"É<p>Recently I decided to upgrade my personal website to a static website since the all the content I needed was static or could be loaded with javascript. In the process I got to look at some of the different static frameworks out there. I thought I would write a short comparison.</p>

<h3>Why static website generator?</h3>

<p>Using a static website generator is not for everyone. If you are running a web application, or dealing with any sort of dynamic content it probably isn't for you.</p>

<p>It is for you if you are running anything where the content is added specifcally by you, or by a group of people. Most common personal sites or blogs can be run on a static website generator. The misconception is in the name. Having a static website generator does not necessarily mean that the website you are building needs each page to be built by hand. Rather we can create resources and rules and generate static content. Much in the same way a dynamic web framework can.</p>

<h3>The search</h3>

<p>My search for the ideal static website framework started where it ususally does, <a href="http://www.hnsearch.com/">Hacker News search</a>. After spending a few minutes looking through the <a href="http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/all&amp;q=static+web+generator&amp;start=0">search results</a> I was able to learn of some different types of static web frameworks as well as find out some of the opinions of the knowledgable community.</p>

<p>Eventually my search led to the <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc website</a> where the author left a semi-complete links to a <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/1-introduction/#similar-projects">large number</a> of open source static website generators. This really became my home base as I could look at the different options. So now I could look at each static framework one by one.</p>

<h3>The examination</h3>

<p>Now that I have begin to look at some of these frameworks lets dig in to them to see if we can find some differences. I started by looking at Jekyll.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is a popular static web framework written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Warner, the founder of Github. Jekyll uses a sensible set of configuration rules to generate static content. It supports layouts and different types of markup to generate into static html. From the github page it lists: RedCloth, Liquid, Classifier, Maruku, and Pygments all as dependencies. This seems to be the most popular static website generator.</p>

<p>Jekyll works well right out of the box, and does not have a large learning curve to hit the ground running. It is a good system to start with if you are familar and just want to crank something out.</p>

<p>The next ruby library I looked at was <a href="http://stasis.me/">Stasis</a>. Stasis features a number of features. It provides layouts and rendering so you can build your web page in blocks. It uses "Controllers" to pre-process code as well as support for self-written helpers in the code. It was nice to see that Stasis supports <a href="http://stasis.me/#more">so many</a> types of markups, thanks to the excellent <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt">tilt gem</a>.</p>

<p>The last ruby static website generator I looked at was <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a>. Nanoc aims to not have be a framework that you step into and start right off the bat. The goal of this project is to create an excellent foundation for you to shape a static framework how you want. It supports a <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/4-basic-concepts/#filters">large number</a> of markups, called "filters". It makes it easy to write additional filters, so adding support for a different markup is simple. You can even write custom filters for binary data. It also supports layouts and rendering if you want to use generic layouts for a blog or a portfolio. It includes helpers that make blogging easier. The site build revolves around its Rules file, which decides how items are routed and filtered before compilation. This allows you to run certain types of items through multiple filters, and change the way that certain items are compiled. For example static assets can be preprocessed by a minimizer and the outputted to a different directory. By default most items are outputted to a directory that is the same as the filename and renamed to index.html. This enables you to have beautiful URLs by default. It also comes with a few extra nice features that help with pre-deployment and deployment. It supports HTML and CSS validating. Also supports deploy configuartion with Rake.</p>

  <p>During the the 2011 school year I attended an engineering fair where they were showing projects the CS students had worked on. One of the projects was AI scheduler. This has been a project that is been laying around the CS department for a while and I wanted to see some outcome. So I was inspired and decided that I would write a library that worked effectivly as an API for the Oregon State Registration System.</p><p>I got to work using some of the python standard packages and wrote what was in essence a large library of screen scraping functions. The library worked similar to the way you would expect an API wrapper to work. This allowed you to manipulate and change classes.</p><p>Even though I put quite a lot of work into this specific project it never gained any traction among the student programmers at OSU, and my interest in maintaining it waned.</p><p>Regardless I spent about 2 more months writing a frontend for the library to illustrate several points in how the registration process could be improved</p><p>I may come back to this project at some point, but repurpose the library using a sturdier library like mechanize and not rely soley on xpaths. Also I would have a server that spawns that would actually expose the classes as a restful API.</p><p>If you are an Oregon State student reading this and are interested in helping plase contact me.</p>

  <p>After spending a year in France, I missed the website <a href="http://www.covoiturage.fr">Covoiturage</a>. This website made it much easier to move between cities and organize rides. I couldn't find a US equivalent at the time, and with my girlfriend living in another city I decided to make my own. This set off a multi-month project where I built RideZap.</p><p>RideZap is written in Ruby on Rails and much of the frontend interaction is handled with the Jquery library.</p>

  <p>This is a project that I started for when I was working for network services at Oregon State University. They needed wanted a frontend to help manage student accounts who had been caught downloading on the school network</p><p>I ended up creating the frontend using Django. The backend ended up working with different school systems that managed student accounts.</a>
