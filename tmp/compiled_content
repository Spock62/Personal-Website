<p>I love to dream about traveling, learning, and creating. I was fortunate enough to be able to spend the last year in France traveling and working.

        <h2>Comparing Static Web Frameworks</h2>
<span>January 09, 2012</span>

      
      <p>Recently I decided to upgrade my personal website to a static website since the all the content I needed was static or could be loaded with javascript. In the process I got to look at some of the different static frameworks out there. I thought I would write a short comparison.</p>

<h3>Why static website generator?</h3>

<p>Using a static website generator is not for everyone. If you are running a web application, or dealing with any sort of dynamic content it probably isn't for you.</p>

<p>It is for you if you are running anything where the content is added specifcally by you, or by a group of people. Most common personal sites or blogs can be run on a static website generator. The misconception is in the name. Having a static website generator does not necessarily mean that the website you are building needs each page to be built by hand. Rather we can create resources, rules and generate static content. Much in the same way a dynamic web framework can.</p>

<h3>The search</h3>

<p>My search for the ideal static website framework started where it ususally does, <a href="http://www.hnsearch.com/">Hacker News search</a>. After spending a few minutes looking through the <a href="http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/all&amp;q=static+web+generator&amp;start=0">search results</a> I was able to learn of some different types of static web frameworks as well as find out some of the opinions of the knowledgable community.</p>

<p>Eventually my search led to the <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc website</a> where the author left a semi-complete links to a <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/1-introduction/#similar-projects">large number</a> of open source static website generators. This really became my home base as I could look at the different options. So now I could look at each static framework one by one.</p>

<h3>The examination</h3>

<p>Now that I have begin to look at some of these frameworks lets dig into them to see if we can find some differences. I started by looking at Jekyll.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is a popular static web framework written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Warner, the founder of Github. Jekyll uses a sensible set of configuration rules to generate static content. It supports layouts and different types of markup to generate into static html. From the github page it lists: RedCloth, Liquid, Classifier, Maruku, and Pygments all as dependencies. This seems to be the most popular static website generator.</p>

<p>Jekyll works well right out of the box, and does not have a large learning curve to hit the ground running. It is a good system to start with if you are familar and just want to crank something out.</p>

<p>The next ruby library I looked at was <a href="http://stasis.me/">Stasis</a>. Stasis features a number of features. It provides layouts and rendering so you can build your web page in blocks. It uses "Controllers" to pre-process code as well as support for self-written helpers in the code. It was nice to see that Stasis supports <a href="http://stasis.me/#more">so many</a> types of markups, thanks to the excellent <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt">tilt gem</a>.</p>

<p>The last ruby static website generator I looked at was <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a>. Nanoc aims to not have be a framework that you step into and start right off the bat. The goal of this project is to create an excellent foundation for you to shape a static framework how you want. It supports a <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/4-basic-concepts/#filters">large number</a> of markups, called "filters". It makes it easy to write additional filters, so adding support for a different markup is simple. You can even write custom filters for binary data. It also supports layouts and rendering if you want to use generic layouts for a blog or a portfolio. It includes helpers that make blogging easier. The site build revolves around its Rules file, which decides how items are routed and filtered before compilation. This allows you to run certain types of items through multiple filters, and change the way that certain items are compiled. For example static assets can be preprocessed by a minimizer and then outputted to a different directory. By default most items are outputted to a directory that is the same as the filename and renamed to index.html. This enables you to have beautiful URLs by default. It also comes with a few extra nice features that help with pre-deployment and deployment. It supports HTML and CSS validating. It also supports deploy configuartion with Rake.</p>

<p>Next I decided to look at some of the python static website generators.</p>

<p>Probably the most mature and popular Python static web page generator is <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a>. Hyde is uses a some specific tools out of the box: the django templating language, support for sass and scss for your CSS files and support for breadcrumbs/excerpts and pagination. It takes a lot of concepts and configurations directly from Jekyll.</p>

<p>I also decided to look at <a href="https://github.com/mythmon/wok">Wok</a>, a project that my friend <a href="https://github.com/mythmon/">Mike Cooper</a> is working on. He wanted to create an alternative to Hyde, Cyrax, Chisel and  another static web page generator in Python. The main thing missing from these was easy category support which he adds to Wok. Wok uses Jinja2 for templating, YAML for adding attaching data to items. Optionally Wok also supports markdown, docutils and pygments. Other markup support is on the way as well, specifically HAML support.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I finally concluded I wanted to use Nanoc because it appears that it is the most flexible option. In the end though you have to remember that all static web frameworks produce the same thing: HTML. This is not a standard web framework debate where you can argue the merits of one framework being faster or slower than another one.</p>

The misconception is in the name. Having a static website generator does not necessarily mean that the website you are building needs each page to be built by hand. Rather we can create resources, rules and generate static content. Much in the same way a dynamic web framework can.

###The search

My search for the ideal static website framework started where it ususally does, <%= link_to("Hacker News search", "http://www.hnsearch.com/") %>. After spending a few minutes looking through the <%= link_to("search results", "http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/all&q=static+web+generator&start=0") %> I was able to learn of some different types of static web frameworks as well as find out some of the opinions of the knowledgable community.

Eventually my search led to the <%= link_to("nanoc website", "http://nanoc.stoneship.org/") %> where the author left a semi-complete links to a <%= link_to("large number", "http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/1-introduction/#similar-projects") %> of open source static website generators. This really became my home base as I could look at the different options. So now I could look at each static framework one by one.

###The examination

Now that I have begin to look at some of these frameworks lets dig into them to see if we can find some differences. I started by looking at Jekyll.

<%= link_to("Jekyll", "https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll") %> is a popular static web framework written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Warner, the founder of Github. Jekyll uses a sensible set of configuration rules to generate static content. It supports layouts and different types of markup to generate into static html. From the github page it lists: RedCloth, Liquid, Classifier, Maruku, and Pygments all as dependencies. This seems to be the most popular static website generator.

Jekyll works well right out of the box, and does not have a large learning curve to hit the ground running. It is a good system to start with if you are familar and just want to crank something out.

The next ruby library I looked at was <%= link_to("Stasis", "http://stasis.me/") %>. Stasis features a number of features. It provides layouts and rendering so you can build your web page in blocks. It uses "Controllers" to pre-process code as well as support for self-written helpers in the code. It was nice to see that Stasis supports <%= link_to("so many", "http://stasis.me/#more") %> types of markups, thanks to the excellent <%= link_to("tilt gem", "https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt") %>.

The last ruby static website generator I looked at was <%= link_to("Nanoc", "http://nanoc.stoneship.org/") %>. Nanoc aims to not have be a framework that you step into and start right off the bat. The goal of this project is to create an excellent foundation for you to shape a static framework how you want. It supports a <%= link_to("large number", "http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/4-basic-concepts/#filters") %> of markups, called "filters". It makes it easy to write additional filters, so adding support for a different markup is simple. You can even write custom filters for binary data. It also supports layouts and rendering if you want to use generic layouts for a blog or a portfolio. It includes helpers that make blogging easier. The site build revolves around its Rules file, which decides how items are routed and filtered before compilation. This allows you to run certain types of items through multiple filters, and change the way that certain items are compiled. For example static assets can be preprocessed by a minimizer and then outputted to a different directory. By default most items are outputted to a directory that is the same as the filename and renamed to index.html. This enables you to have beautiful URLs by default. It also comes with a few extra nice features that help with pre-deployment and deployment. It supports HTML and CSS validating. It also supports deploy configuartion with Rake.

Next I decided to look at some of the python static website generators.

Probably the most mature and popular Python static web page generator is <%= link_to("Hyde", "http://ringce.com/hyde") %>. Hyde is uses a some specific tools out of the box: the django templating language, support for sass and scss for your CSS files and support for breadcrumbs/excerpts and pagination. It takes a lot of concepts and configurations directly from Jekyll.

I also decided to look at <%= link_to("Wok", "https://github.com/mythmon/wok") %>, a project that my friend <%= link_to("Mike Cooper", "https://github.com/mythmon/") %> is working on. He wanted to create an alternative to Hyde, Cyrax, Chisel and  another static web page generator in Python. The main thing missing from these was easy category support which he adds to Wok. Wok uses Jinja2 for templating, YAML for adding attaching data to items. Optionally Wok also supports markdown, docutils and pygments. Other markup support is on the way as well, specifically HAML support. 

###Conclusion

I finally concluded I wanted to use Nanoc because it appears that it is the most flexible option. In the end though you have to remember that all static web frameworks produce the same thing: HTML. This is not a standard web framework debate where you can argue the merits of one framework being faster or slower than another one.;T;
I"Ñ<p>Recently I decided to upgrade my personal website to a static website since the all the content I needed was static or could be loaded with javascript. In the process I got to look at some of the different static frameworks out there. I thought I would write a short comparison.</p>

  <p>During the the 2011 school year I attended an engineering fair where they were showing projects the CS students had worked on. One of the projects was AI scheduler. This has been a project that is been laying around the CS department for a while and I wanted to see some outcome. So I was inspired and decided that I would write a library that worked effectivly as an API for the Oregon State Registration System.</p><p>I got to work using some of the python standard packages and wrote what was in essence a large library of screen scraping functions. The library worked similar to the way you would expect an API wrapper to work. This allowed you to manipulate and change classes.</p><p>Even though I put quite a lot of work into this specific project it never gained any traction among the student programmers at OSU, and my interest in maintaining it waned.</p><p>Regardless I spent about 2 more months writing a frontend for the library to illustrate several points in how the registration process could be improved</p><p>I may come back to this project at some point, but repurpose the library using a sturdier library like mechanize and not rely soley on xpaths. Also I would have a server that spawns that would actually expose the classes as a restful API.</p><p>If you are an Oregon State student reading this and are interested in helping plase contact me.</p>

  <p>After spending a year in France, I missed the website <a href="http://www.covoiturage.fr">Covoiturage</a>. This website made it much easier to move between cities and organize rides. I couldn't find a US equivalent at the time, and with my girlfriend living in another city I decided to make my own. This set off a multi-month project where I built RideZap.</p><p>RideZap is written in Ruby on Rails and much of the frontend interaction is handled with the Jquery library.</p>

  <p>During the Spring term of 2011 the Oregon State Linux Users group upgraded their Drupal install wiping out the old theme. I stepped in to perform some emergancy surgery on the site and restore it to something other than the default drupal theme.</p>

  <p>This is a project that I started for when I was working for network services at Oregon State University. They needed wanted a frontend to help manage student accounts who had been caught downloading on the school network</p><p>I ended up creating the frontend using Django. The backend ended up working with different school systems that managed student accounts.</a>

        <h2>A recap of my time at Startup School 2011</h2>
<span>November 01, 2011</span>

      
      <p>This year I was fortunate enough to be able to attend <a href="http://startupschool.org/">Startup School</a>. It was my first opportunity and I was excited to go after seeing some of the reaction of people who had gone before and posted their experience on Hacker News. So after flying down from Oregon, staying with the Cloudkick, I ended up arranging a ride to Stanford using the excellent tool provided by <a href="http://www.ridejoy.com">Ridejoy</a>.</p>

<p>The ride down was interesting, I met two bio-tech graduate students, and the author of a chrome extension(can't find the link to this specific one). When we arrived there was a generous spread out for breakfast. Throughout the entire day I was a extremely impressed by Y-Combinator giving out food so nicely at a free conference. They served pizza for lunch and provided snacks afterwords.</p>

<h2>The Talks</h2>

<p>Finding a seat wasn't too tough at the beginning. A few minutes after the talk it appeared that their were people standing around the edges of the auditorium. It appeared this way until the very end when some people left early. On to the speakers.</p>

<h3>Marc Andreessen</h3>

<p>Marc Andreessen was the first speaker to talk, for his talk he was interviewed by Paul Graham(from here on out referred to by "PG"). The interview started out by PG referencing the <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0182.html">famous thread</a> about Mr. Andreesen proposing the IMG tag. The talk continued about the challenges Mr. Andreesen had scaling Netscape. He specifically referenced the challenges hiring in the valley from companies such as Oracle and HP with strong cultures. He said hiring from these cultures could create factions within Netscape.</p>

<h3>James Lindenbaum</h3>

<p>James Lindenbaum of Heroku was the next speaker. This was probably my favorite talk of the day. He discussed the origins of Heroku, and its eventual aquisition. He talked about Heroku's evolution from being a web application for beginning Rails developers to a hosting platform with ultra simple development. He said that he believed that future is with cloud services like his and ones that his platform runs on, services like Parse, Loggly and other Services like this. His slides were absolutely fantastic and well designed. Another interesting thing he brought up, even though they were acquired by Salesforce they maintain their own office and culture. There is little-to-none interference from the company that bought them. The biggest takeaway from this for me was using current smaller cloud based services to leverage your ability to develop rapidly.</p>

<h3>Jim Goetz</h3>

<p>Jim Goetz is a Partner at Sequoia. He spent most of his talk speaking about Startups they had funded and addressing some criticisms of Venture Capitalists.</p>

<h3>Ashton Kutcher</h3>

<p>This was a surprise speaker. He wasn't announced on the Startup School website I imagine this was partially due to the fact that he is a celebrity and they did not want to attract a crowd. He told a long story about a turn of the century marketer that finished penniless, but none less devoted his life to what he loved. His question and answer section was interesting. He was very engaging wanting to know the questioners first names and taking on a friendly tone. My favorite question from the Q&amp;A was, "I know that your background is not quiet technical, what do you bring on to the table for a new startup?"(or something to that effect). I thought he did a good job addressing that by admitting that he wasn't the most technically proficient investor, but that he could bring other skills to the table. He gave the example where Tumblr and Foursquare were in competition for and he was able to make a call and swing the engineer him towards Foursquare.</p>

<h3>Matt Mullenweg</h3>

<p>This was another one of my favorite talks. Matt talked about his transition into Silicon Valley. How he started Wordpress while he was living in Houston, Texas and eventually moved onto to working for cnet. At cnet he was able to maintain a regular salary and still work on Wordpress on the side. Throughout his talk he continued to emphasize the importance of Open Source and exploring fun side projects. Eventually he decided to branch out and work full time on Wordpress. This was the founding of <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>. He continued to talk about how this became his passion, even to the point that he turned down a 9 figure acquistion offer. He said that it is better to have something you love to work on, then to have a large sum of money.</p>

<h3>Mark Pincus</h3>

<p>Mark is the founder Zynga. I couldn't track very well what he was saying and this was before lunch, so I don't have much to add for this talk. He did make some interesting points about A/B testing people to see how they could get to play their poker games more.</p>

<h3>Paul Graham</h3>

<p>This was the talk I was looking forward to the most. He started out his talk emphasizing that it was important not to start a company just for the sake of starting a company. He said that he has seen an increase in the trend of people moving to the valley, starting a company before they have an idea what they are going to do. This led into to his next point which was, you shouldn't try to think of "ideas" to start a company. You should go out and find "problems".</p>

<p>The rest of his time on the stage was done in an office hours sort of way. He talked to 4 startups all who had applied to be in the Y-Combinator program. He challenged all of them pretty hard, while still giving constructive feedback. These office hours seem incredibly powerful to me, because he seems to approach the ideas in a different way then the founders have envisioned.</p>

<h3>Mark Zuckerberg</h3>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg came and did a short Q&amp;A with Jessica Livingston. He spoke about strategy and remaining open to take risks. The questioning seemed to be focused on the past and things he would have done differently. I felt as if Ms. Livingston was almost alluding to some of the issues that have become so sensationalized the past few years, several times after a question Mr. Zuckerberg smirked and then answered the question in a different suprising way. The feeling I got from most of his answers was that he wanted to talk about the future of Facebook not the past. The answer that received the most attention was his answer that if he had his experience now that he might not have left Boston. Even though this answer was pretty non-committal it seemed to be the focus of a Techcrunch piece the next day. He talked about the importance of being a risk taker and that in this modern economy it is probably the only way to survive. The most interesting thing for me from this talk was what he said about the future of application development. He said that he believed that most future applications would be built on top of some social graph.</p>

<h3>Stephen Cohen</h3>

<p>Mr. Cohen is the founder of Palantir, a private government based contracter that helps the government with different data analytics problem. He talked about the challenges in creating Palantir and building large enterprise software. He told many fun stories about the early days, especially on between the early founders and the government. They called a very early meeting and outfitted their office to make it appear that they had employed more people than they actually did. When the government employees asked about all the empty desks he told them that it was typical in Silicon Valley for people to come to work later.</p>

<h3>Max Levchin</h3>

<p>This was another one of my favorite talks. He came up and talked about the founding of Paypal and some of his other ventures. He talked about the importance of picking a founder and some of the methods he used to pick his founder Peter Thiel. His talk included many jokes which made it sound pretty natural and was fun to listen to. His speaking style and demeanor seem to exude intelligence which was fun to watch. He also mentioned at the end of his talk that it is important not to let your office become a dump as this will often be something that is difficult to get rid of, even if you move offices as you will bring much of the stuff that made the old office a dump.</p>

<h3>Ron Conway</h3>

<p>This was probably my least favorite talk. It started out well enough, but soon turned into a slide show of Ron Conway with different successful entrepreneurs and celebrities and him listing off his experiences with different famous entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3>Drew Houston</h3>

<p>Mr. Houston is the founder of Dropbox, he gave a nice account of his transition from being a college student to startup founder. He talked about the challenges acquiring some of the business skills required to found a successful startup, but said that he was able to learn a lot just through reading. He pointed out that he believed it was easier for Software Engineer to make the transition into the business side of things than it would be for a non-technical co-founder into working with the software side of things.</p>

<h2>Afterwords</h2>

<p>After the conclusion of startup school, I ended up going to the front and waiting to talk to Paul Graham. This was probably the highlight of my time there. I was able to thank him for inviting me and to discuss briefly <em>Hackers and Painters</em>, the book he wrote.</p>

<p>I then went to the snacks outside where I was fortunate enough to meet Samuel Clay. I enjoyed talking to him about DocumentCloud and some of the work that he did with Jeremy Ashkenas. It was neat to talk to one of the original contributors of both Backbone.js and Underscore.js.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It was a great experience to attend startup school. i very much getting to meet many different types of people. I feel that Paul Graham's point sticks with me the most though. You should not just start a company just for the sake of starting a company. Having an idea and vision is important, things should not be the secondary concern. Thanks to the whole Y-Combinator crew for putting this on and happy hacking!</p>

So after flying down from Oregon, staying with the Cloudkick, I ended up arranging a ride to Stanford using the excellent tool provided by <%= link_to("Ridejoy", "http://www.ridejoy.com") %>.

The ride down was interesting, I met two bio-tech graduate students, and the author of a chrome extension(can't find the link to this specific one). When we arrived there was a generous spread out for breakfast. Throughout the entire day I was a extremely impressed by Y-Combinator giving out food so nicely at a free conference. They served pizza for lunch and provided snacks afterwords. 


The Talks
----

Finding a seat wasn't too tough at the beginning. A few minutes after the talk it appeared that their were people standing around the edges of the auditorium. It appeared this way until the very end when some people left early. On to the speakers.

###Marc Andreessen

Marc Andreessen was the first speaker to talk, for his talk he was interviewed by Paul Graham(from here on out referred to by "PG"). The interview started out by PG referencing the <%= link_to("famous thread", "http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0182.html") %> about Mr. Andreesen proposing the IMG tag. The talk continued about the challenges Mr. Andreesen had scaling Netscape. He specifically referenced the challenges hiring in the valley from companies such as Oracle and HP with strong cultures. He said hiring from these cultures could create factions within Netscape.

###James Lindenbaum

James Lindenbaum of Heroku was the next speaker. This was probably my favorite talk of the day. He discussed the origins of Heroku, and its eventual aquisition. He talked about Heroku's evolution from being a web application for beginning Rails developers to a hosting platform with ultra simple development. He said that he believed that future is with cloud services like his and ones that his platform runs on, services like Parse, Loggly and other Services like this. His slides were absolutely fantastic and well designed. Another interesting thing he brought up, even though they were acquired by Salesforce they maintain their own office and culture. There is little-to-none interference from the company that bought them. The biggest takeaway from this for me was using current smaller cloud based services to leverage your ability to develop rapidly.

###Jim Goetz

Jim Goetz is a Partner at Sequoia. He spent most of his talk speaking about Startups they had funded and addressing some criticisms of Venture Capitalists.

###Ashton Kutcher

This was a surprise speaker. He wasn't announced on the Startup School website I imagine this was partially due to the fact that he is a celebrity and they did not want to attract a crowd. He told a long story about a turn of the century marketer that finished penniless, but none less devoted his life to what he loved. His question and answer section was interesting. He was very engaging wanting to know the questioners first names and taking on a friendly tone. My favorite question from the Q&A was, "I know that your background is not quiet technical, what do you bring on to the table for a new startup?"(or something to that effect). I thought he did a good job addressing that by admitting that he wasn't the most technically proficient investor, but that he could bring other skills to the table. He gave the example where Tumblr and Foursquare were in competition for and he was able to make a call and swing the engineer him towards Foursquare. 


###Matt Mullenweg

This was another one of my favorite talks. Matt talked about his transition into Silicon Valley. How he started Wordpress while he was living in Houston, Texas and eventually moved onto to working for cnet. At cnet he was able to maintain a regular salary and still work on Wordpress on the side. Throughout his talk he continued to emphasize the importance of Open Source and exploring fun side projects. Eventually he decided to branch out and work full time on Wordpress. This was the founding of <%= link_to("Automattic", "http://automattic.com/") %>. He continued to talk about how this became his passion, even to the point that he turned down a 9 figure acquistion offer. He said that it is better to have something you love to work on, then to have a large sum of money.

###Mark Pincus

Mark is the founder Zynga. I couldn't track very well what he was saying and this was before lunch, so I don't have much to add for this talk. He did make some interesting points about A/B testing people to see how they could get to play their poker games more.

###Paul Graham

This was the talk I was looking forward to the most. He started out his talk emphasizing that it was important not to start a company just for the sake of starting a company. He said that he has seen an increase in the trend of people moving to the valley, starting a company before they have an idea what they are going to do. This led into to his next point which was, you shouldn't try to think of "ideas" to start a company. You should go out and find "problems".

The rest of his time on the stage was done in an office hours sort of way. He talked to 4 startups all who had applied to be in the Y-Combinator program. He challenged all of them pretty hard, while still giving constructive feedback. These office hours seem incredibly powerful to me, because he seems to approach the ideas in a different way then the founders have envisioned.

###Mark Zuckerberg

Mark Zuckerberg came and did a short Q&A with Jessica Livingston. He spoke about strategy and remaining open to take risks. The questioning seemed to be focused on the past and things he would have done differently. I felt as if Ms. Livingston was almost alluding to some of the issues that have become so sensationalized the past few years, several times after a question Mr. Zuckerberg smirked and then answered the question in a different suprising way. The feeling I got from most of his answers was that he wanted to talk about the future of Facebook not the past. The answer that received the most attention was his answer that if he had his experience now that he might not have left Boston. Even though this answer was pretty non-committal it seemed to be the focus of a Techcrunch piece the next day. He talked about the importance of being a risk taker and that in this modern economy it is probably the only way to survive. The most interesting thing for me from this talk was what he said about the future of application development. He said that he believed that most future applications would be built on top of some social graph.

###Stephen Cohen

Mr. Cohen is the founder of Palantir, a private government based contracter that helps the government with different data analytics problem. He talked about the challenges in creating Palantir and building large enterprise software. He told many fun stories about the early days, especially on between the early founders and the government. They called a very early meeting and outfitted their office to make it appear that they had employed more people than they actually did. When the government employees asked about all the empty desks he told them that it was typical in Silicon Valley for people to come to work later.

###Max Levchin

This was another one of my favorite talks. He came up and talked about the founding of Paypal and some of his other ventures. He talked about the importance of picking a founder and some of the methods he used to pick his founder Peter Thiel. His talk included many jokes which made it sound pretty natural and was fun to listen to. His speaking style and demeanor seem to exude intelligence which was fun to watch. He also mentioned at the end of his talk that it is important not to let your office become a dump as this will often be something that is difficult to get rid of, even if you move offices as you will bring much of the stuff that made the old office a dump.

###Ron Conway

This was probably my least favorite talk. It started out well enough, but soon turned into a slide show of Ron Conway with different successful entrepreneurs and celebrities and him listing off his experiences with different famous entrepreneurs. 

###Drew Houston

Mr. Houston is the founder of Dropbox, he gave a nice account of his transition from being a college student to startup founder. He talked about the challenges acquiring some of the business skills required to found a successful startup, but said that he was able to learn a lot just through reading. He pointed out that he believed it was easier for Software Engineer to make the transition into the business side of things than it would be for a non-technical co-founder into working with the software side of things.

Afterwords
---
After the conclusion of startup school, I ended up going to the front and waiting to talk to Paul Graham. This was probably the highlight of my time there. I was able to thank him for inviting me and to discuss briefly *Hackers and Painters*, the book he wrote. 

I then went to the snacks outside where I was fortunate enough to meet Samuel Clay. I enjoyed talking to him about DocumentCloud and some of the work that he did with Jeremy Ashkenas. It was neat to talk to one of the original contributors of both Backbone.js and Underscore.js.

Conclusion
---
It was a great experience to attend startup school. i very much getting to meet many different types of people. I feel that Paul Graham's point sticks with me the most though. You should not just start a company just for the sake of starting a company. Having an idea and vision is important, things should not be the secondary concern. Thanks to the whole Y-Combinator crew for putting this on and happy hacking!;T;

        <h2>Open sourcing Ridezap</h2>
<span>November 05, 2011</span>

      
      <p><a href="http://www.ridezap.com">Ridezap</a> is getting <a href="https://github.com/thedjpetersen/Ridezap_os/">open sourced</a>! After 3 hard months of work I decided that this project should be public. Why? This is a great project, but it didn't gain any real momentum after I released it. I think there is a serious need for ridesharing in the US, this becoming increasingly evident to me after my trip in Europe and the large amount of ridesharing options there.</p>

<p>Ridesharing is an important overlooked issue. It makes movement easier for those without a steady transportation. It provides an economic benefit to the driver. Probably most importantly it cuts down on congestion and is beneficial to the environment.</p>

<p>There are a few ridesharing options in the US most notably <a href="http://www.zimride.com">Zimride</a> and <a href="http://www.ridejoy.com">RideJoy</a>. Zimride has been around for a few years and has quiet a bit more momentum than RideJoy. Each site is good, I prefer the visual experience in Zimride, but like the fact that you can do on the spot cash interactions on RideJoy.</p>

<p>So if you are excited about ridesharing and would like to do a website, feel free to use this code as a base. If you need a small solution for your organization you could as well. If you just want to contribute to this project that would make me tremendously happy and your contributions will probably get into Ridezap.com which I will continue to run.</p>

<p>A quick note on what Ridezap was built on. I built the site in Rails, migrated it forward to the 3.1 release. A lot of the frontend interaction is done with jQuery, and certain elements of the site use jQuery UI. The look and feel is largely from twitter's bootstrap framework.</p>

/*
The deck.core module provides all the basic functionality for creating and
moving through a deck.  It does so by applying classes to indicate the state of
the deck and its slides, allowing CSS to take care of the visual representation
of each state.  It also provides methods for navigating the deck and inspecting
its state, as well as basic key bindings for going to the next and previous
slides.  More functionality is provided by wholly separate extension modules
that use the API provided by core.

<span>November 15, 2011</span>

      
      <p>I thought I would write down some of the ideas that have been bouncing around my head.</p>

<h2>Irc Client</h2>

<p>A client that connects to a "client server" which has been idling in channels for you and collecting logs. The clients interface would be as a web page. I was inspired by seeing the <a href="http://www.grove.io">Grove.io</a> project. I thought that it would be possible to have a really clean web frontend that connects to a backend that you are running on your computer.</p>

<h2>Addictive language learning</h2>

<p>If you look in the playground section of my site you will see that I have been working on a simple language game. The idea is to give new problems as fast as people can solve them. Trying to find some way to make learning a new language more addictive. To make people at some subconcious level not want to forget words or leave the game because they are playing for something insignificant(points or badges).</p>

<h2>Card encryption</h2>

<p>I read on Hacker News tonight that every combination of suffuled cards <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3241092">is unique</a>. Someone suggested in the comments that it would be very clever in a bond movie to have James Bond show up with a card deck that would be the key to some sort of encryption and then throw the cards into the air when he was caught. This got me to thinking, write some sort of script that can encrypt on seeing the order of some cards. It would be even cooler if this was done using OCR and you could just hold a deck up to the camera and then you would have your encrpytion.</p>

<h2>Better playlist creation and sharing.</h2>

<p>There are many methods and opportunities for creating and sharing music. What I would like to see is a better way for creating playlist already with the transitions. It would be nice for a service where you could post, "I need a playlist for this type of situation tonight", and other people could suggest to you already mixed playlists.</p>

<h2>Automation on steroids</h2>

<p> is a cool new service that allows you to create little task automations. Based on the inputs from different services you are able to funnel data and manipulate it. It takes advantage of many web APIs and creates an easy to use interface. What I would like to see is an easier way to do automation and more complex automation. With an interface similar to Yahoo Pipes. You could drag services and "connect" them with pipes. Also being able to use boolean logic to make them look similar to add something similar to "AND" and "OR" gates on boolean logic would be cool.</p>

        <h2>Comparing web chat clients</h2>
<span>March 26, 2012</span>

      
      <p>I have been working the last two month on <a href="https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway">Subway</a> an IRC web client. During this time I have discovered some of the other options that exist. I thought I would go ahead and share them with you.</p>

<h2>Alice</h2>

<p><img src="http://usealice.org/image/screenshots/new/3.png" style="width: 700px" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.usealice.org/">Alice</a> is probably the most
mature option in the bunch. It runs as a server in the backend which
handles the IRC connections and logs messages so you can see them when
you log back in. It persists your connection to the server as well.</p>

<h2>Holla</h2>

<p><img

<p><a href="https://github.com/maccman/holla">Holla</a> is another
open source application written in Ruby. It serves as both the server
and the client. The logging is done in Redis, a data store system
optimized for speed.</p>

<h2>Candy</h2>

<p><img
src="http://candy-chat.github.com/candy/public/images/screenshot.png" style="width: 700px"/></p>

<p><a href="http://candy-chat.github.com/candy/">Candy</a> is another client server option written in fully in javascript
built on top of XMPP for communities to chat with each other. I didn't
see whether or not logging/search was built in.</p>

<h2>QWebIRC</h2>

<p><a href="http://qwebirc.org/">QWebIRC</a> is a online IRC client that has been around for more than 4
years. It was designed for use in on the quake network.</p>

;T;	I"#I have been working the last two month on <%= link_to("Subway", "https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway") %> an IRC web client. During this time I have discovered some of the other options that exist. I thought I would go ahead and share them with you.

## Alice

<%= link_to("Alice", "http://www.usealice.org/") %> is probably the most
mature option in the bunch. It runs as a server in the backend which
handles the IRC connections and logs messages so you can see them when
you log back in. It persists your connection to the server as well.

## Holla

<%= link_to("Holla", "https://github.com/maccman/holla") %> is another
open source application written in Ruby. It serves as both the server
and the client. The logging is done in Redis, a data store system
optimized for speed.

## Candy

<%= link_to("Candy", "http://candy-chat.github.com/candy/") %> is another client server option written in fully in javascript
built on top of XMPP for communities to chat with each other. I didn't
see whether or not logging/search was built in.

## QWebIRC

<%= link_to("QWebIRC", "http://qwebirc.org/") %> is a online IRC client that has been around for more than 4
years. It was designed for use in on the quake network.;T;
