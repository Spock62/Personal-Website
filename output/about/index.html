<p>My name is David Petersen. I live in Rainy Corvallis Oregon. I enjoy soccer, traveling, and cooking.</p>

<p>I love to dream about traveling, learning, and creating. I was fortunate enough to be able to spend the last year in France traveling and working. The chance to live in Paris for 6 months was truely eye opening for me. I had never been in a city that had a heartbeat of its own. Adjusting to a new culture was a wonderful experience for me. I fell in love with the food, <i>l'art de vivre</i>, and was fortunate to bring back a girlfriend as well.</p>

<p>I have found that web is a means of creative outlet for me. I started learning HTML and CSS several years ago and have just been recently introduced to Ruby on Rails and Django. Both of these frameworks have turned out to be an excellent means of turning ideas quickly into reality. This is what I have found myself to being truely passionate about, being able to find a problem with the world and try to address it using technology. I have began to enjoy working more with Ruby on Rails, but I also work with Django for work. I don't feel tightly bound to one programming language or another, I am somewhat of a language agnostic, even though I do tend to drift toward python for most scripting projects.</p>

<p>This website will serve as a outlet for my portfolio and my thoughs on programming. I am also open to work as a freelancer on your next project. My contact information is available through the contact section of this site.</p>
