        <h2>Open sourcing Ridezap</h2>
<span>November 05, 2011</span>

      
      <p><a href="http://www.ridezap.com">Ridezap</a> is getting <a href="https://github.com/thedjpetersen/Ridezap_os/">open sourced</a>! After 3 hard months of work I decided that this project should be public. Why? This is a great project, but it didn't gain any real momentum after I released it. I think there is a serious need for ridesharing in the US, this becoming increasingly evident to me after my trip in Europe and the large amount of ridesharing options there.</p>

<p>Ridesharing is an important overlooked issue. It makes movement easier for those without a steady transportation. It provides an economic benefit to the driver. Probably most importantly it cuts down on congestion and is beneficial to the environment.</p>

<p>There are a few ridesharing options in the US most notably <a href="http://www.zimride.com">Zimride</a> and <a href="http://www.ridejoy.com">RideJoy</a>. Zimride has been around for a few years and has quiet a bit more momentum than RideJoy. Each site is good, I prefer the visual experience in Zimride, but like the fact that you can do on the spot cash interactions on RideJoy.</p>

<p>So if you are excited about ridesharing and would like to do a website, feel free to use this code as a base. If you need a small solution for your organization you could as well. If you just want to contribute to this project that would make me tremendously happy and your contributions will probably get into Ridezap.com which I will continue to run.</p>

<p>A quick note on what Ridezap was built on. I built the site in Rails, migrated it forward to the 3.1 release. A lot of the frontend interaction is done with jQuery, and certain elements of the site use jQuery UI. The look and feel is largely from twitter's bootstrap framework.</p>
