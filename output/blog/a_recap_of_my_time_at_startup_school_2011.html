        <h2>A recap of my time at Startup School 2011</h2>
<span>November 01, 2011</span>

      
      <p>This year I was fortunate enough to be able to attend <a href="http://startupschool.org/">Startup School</a>. It was my first opportunity and I was excited to go after seeing some of the reaction of people who had gone before and posted their experience on Hacker News. So after flying down from Oregon, staying with the Cloudkick, I ended up arranging a ride to Stanford using the excellent tool provided by <a href="http://www.ridejoy.com">Ridejoy</a>.</p>

<p>The ride down was interesting, I met two bio-tech graduate students, and the author of a chrome extension(can't find the link to this specific one). When we arrived there was a generous spread out for breakfast. Throughout the entire day I was a extremely impressed by Y-Combinator giving out food so nicely at a free conference. They served pizza for lunch and provided snacks afterwords.</p>

<h2>The Talks</h2>

<p>Finding a seat wasn't too tough at the beginning. A few minutes after the talk it appeared that their were people standing around the edges of the auditorium. It appeared this way until the very end when some people left early. On to the speakers.</p>

<h3>Marc Andreessen</h3>

<p>Marc Andreessen was the first speaker to talk, for his talk he was interviewed by Paul Graham(from here on out referred to by "PG"). The interview started out by PG referencing the <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0182.html">famous thread</a> about Mr. Andreesen proposing the IMG tag. The talk continued about the challenges Mr. Andreesen had scaling Netscape. He specifically referenced the challenges hiring in the valley from companies such as Oracle and HP with strong cultures. He said hiring from these cultures could create factions within Netscape.</p>

<h3>James Lindenbaum</h3>

<p>James Lindenbaum of Heroku was the next speaker. This was probably my favorite talk of the day. He discussed the origins of Heroku, and its eventual aquisition. He talked about Heroku's evolution from being a web application for beginning Rails developers to a hosting platform with ultra simple development. He said that he believed that future is with cloud services like his and ones that his platform runs on, services like Parse, Loggly and other Services like this. His slides were absolutely fantastic and well designed. Another interesting thing he brought up, even though they were acquired by Salesforce they maintain their own office and culture. There is little-to-none interference from the company that bought them. The biggest takeaway from this for me was using current smaller cloud based services to leverage your ability to develop rapidly.</p>

<h3>Jim Goetz</h3>

<p>Jim Goetz is a Partner at Sequoia. He spent most of his talk speaking about Startups they had funded and addressing some criticisms of Venture Capitalists.</p>

<h3>Ashton Kutcher</h3>

<p>This was a surprise speaker. He wasn't announced on the Startup School website I imagine this was partially due to the fact that he is a celebrity and they did not want to attract a crowd. He told a long story about a turn of the century marketer that finished penniless, but none less devoted his life to what he loved. His question and answer section was interesting. He was very engaging wanting to know the questioners first names and taking on a friendly tone. My favorite question from the Q&amp;A was, "I know that your background is not quiet technical, what do you bring on to the table for a new startup?"(or something to that effect). I thought he did a good job addressing that by admitting that he wasn't the most technically proficient investor, but that he could bring other skills to the table. He gave the example where Tumblr and Foursquare were in competition for and he was able to make a call and swing the engineer him towards Foursquare.</p>

<h3>Matt Mullenweg</h3>

<p>This was another one of my favorite talks. Matt talked about his transition into Silicon Valley. How he started Wordpress while he was living in Houston, Texas and eventually moved onto to working for cnet. At cnet he was able to maintain a regular salary and still work on Wordpress on the side. Throughout his talk he continued to emphasize the importance of Open Source and exploring fun side projects. Eventually he decided to branch out and work full time on Wordpress. This was the founding of <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>. He continued to talk about how this became his passion, even to the point that he turned down a 9 figure acquistion offer. He said that it is better to have something you love to work on, then to have a large sum of money.</p>

<h3>Mark Pincus</h3>

<p>Mark is the founder Zynga. I couldn't track very well what he was saying and this was before lunch, so I don't have much to add for this talk. He did make some interesting points about A/B testing people to see how they could get to play their poker games more.</p>

<h3>Paul Graham</h3>

<p>This was the talk I was looking forward to the most. He started out his talk emphasizing that it was important not to start a company just for the sake of starting a company. He said that he has seen an increase in the trend of people moving to the valley, starting a company before they have an idea what they are going to do. This led into to his next point which was, you shouldn't try to think of "ideas" to start a company. You should go out and find "problems".</p>

<p>The rest of his time on the stage was done in an office hours sort of way. He talked to 4 startups all who had applied to be in the Y-Combinator program. He challenged all of them pretty hard, while still giving constructive feedback. These office hours seem incredibly powerful to me, because he seems to approach the ideas in a different way then the founders have envisioned.</p>

<h3>Mark Zuckerberg</h3>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg came and did a short Q&amp;A with Jessica Livingston. He spoke about strategy and remaining open to take risks. The questioning seemed to be focused on the past and things he would have done differently. I felt as if Ms. Livingston was almost alluding to some of the issues that have become so sensationalized the past few years, several times after a question Mr. Zuckerberg smirked and then answered the question in a different suprising way. The feeling I got from most of his answers was that he wanted to talk about the future of Facebook not the past. The answer that received the most attention was his answer that if he had his experience now that he might not have left Boston. Even though this answer was pretty non-committal it seemed to be the focus of a Techcrunch piece the next day. He talked about the importance of being a risk taker and that in this modern economy it is probably the only way to survive. The most interesting thing for me from this talk was what he said about the future of application development. He said that he believed that most future applications would be built on top of some social graph.</p>

<h3>Stephen Cohen</h3>

<p>Mr. Cohen is the founder of Palantir, a private government based contracter that helps the government with different data analytics problem. He talked about the challenges in creating Palantir and building large enterprise software. He told many fun stories about the early days, especially on between the early founders and the government. They called a very early meeting and outfitted their office to make it appear that they had employed more people than they actually did. When the government employees asked about all the empty desks he told them that it was typical in Silicon Valley for people to come to work later.</p>

<h3>Max Levchin</h3>

<p>This was another one of my favorite talks. He came up and talked about the founding of Paypal and some of his other ventures. He talked about the importance of picking a founder and some of the methods he used to pick his founder Peter Thiel. His talk included many jokes which made it sound pretty natural and was fun to listen to. His speaking style and demeanor seem to exude intelligence which was fun to watch. He also mentioned at the end of his talk that it is important not to let your office become a dump as this will often be something that is difficult to get rid of, even if you move offices as you will bring much of the stuff that made the old office a dump.</p>

<h3>Ron Conway</h3>

<p>This was probably my least favorite talk. It started out well enough, but soon turned into a slide show of Ron Conway with different successful entrepreneurs and celebrities and him listing off his experiences with different famous entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3>Drew Houston</h3>

<p>Mr. Houston is the founder of Dropbox, he gave a nice account of his transition from being a college student to startup founder. He talked about the challenges acquiring some of the business skills required to found a successful startup, but said that he was able to learn a lot just through reading. He pointed out that he believed it was easier for Software Engineer to make the transition into the business side of things than it would be for a non-technical co-founder into working with the software side of things.</p>

<h2>Afterwords</h2>

<p>After the conclusion of startup school, I ended up going to the front and waiting to talk to Paul Graham. This was probably the highlight of my time there. I was able to thank him for inviting me and to discuss briefly <em>Hackers and Painters</em>, the book he wrote.</p>

<p>I then went to the snacks outside where I was fortunate enough to meet Samuel Clay. I enjoyed talking to him about DocumentCloud and some of the work that he did with Jeremy Ashkenas. It was neat to talk to one of the original contributors of both Backbone.js and Underscore.js.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It was a great experience to attend startup school. i very much getting to meet many different types of people. I feel that Paul Graham's point sticks with me the most though. You should not just start a company just for the sake of starting a company. Having an idea and vision is important, things should not be the secondary concern. Thanks to the whole Y-Combinator crew for putting this on and happy hacking!</p>
