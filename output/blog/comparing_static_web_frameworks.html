        <h2>Comparing Static Web Frameworks</h2>
<span>October 11, 2011</span>

      
      <p>Recently I decided to upgrade my personal website to a static website since the all the content I needed was static. In the process I got to look at some of the different static frameworks out there. I thought I would write a short comparison.</p>

<h3>Why static website generator?</h3>

<p>Using a static website generator for everyone is not for everyone. If you are running a web application, or dealing with any sort of dynamic content it probably isn't for you.</p>

<p>It is for you if you are running anything where the content is added specifcally by you, or by a group of people. The misconception is in the name. Having a static website generator does not necessarily mean that the website you are building is going to be <em>static</em>.</p>

<h3>The search</h3>

<p>My search for the ideal static website framework* started where it ususally does, <a href="http://www.hnsearch.com/">Hacker News search</a>. After spending a few minutes looking through the <a href="http://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/02/list-static-website-generators.html">search results</a> I was able to learn of some different types of static web frameworks as well as find out some of the opinions of the knowledgable community.</p>

<p>Eventually my search led to the <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc website</a> where the author left a semi-complete links to a <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/1-introduction/#similar-projects">large number</a> of open source static website generators. This really became my home base as I could look at the different options.</p>
