        <h2>Dreaming the November 2011 edition</h2>
<span>November 15, 2011</span>

      
      <p>I thought I would write down some of the ideas that have been bouncing around my head.</p>

<h2>Irc Client</h2>

<p>A client that connects to a "client server" which has been idling in channels for you and collecting logs. The clients interface would be as a web page. I was inspired by seeing the <a href="http://www.grove.io">Grove.io</a> project. I thought that it would be possible to have a really clean web frontend that connects to a backend that you are running on your computer.</p>

<h2>Addictive language learning</h2>

<p>If you look in the playground section of my site you will see that I have been working on a simple language game. The idea is to give new problems as fast as people can solve them. Trying to find some way to make learning a new language more addictive. To make people at some subconcious level not want to forget words or leave the game because they are playing for something insignificant(points or badges).</p>

<h2>Card encryption</h2>

<p>I read on Hacker News tonight that every combination of suffuled cards <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3241092">is unique</a>. Someone suggested in the comments that it would be very clever in a bond movie to have James Bond show up with a card deck that would be the key to some sort of encryption and then throw the cards into the air when he was caught. This got me to thinking, write some sort of script that can encrypt on seeing the order of some cards. It would be even cooler if this was done using OCR and you could just hold a deck up to the camera and then you would have your encrpytion.</p>

<h2>Better playlist creation and sharing.</h2>

<p>There are many methods and opportunities for creating and sharing music. What I would like to see is a better way for creating playlist already with the transitions. It would be nice for a service where you could post, "I need a playlist for this type of situation tonight", and other people could suggest to you already mixed playlists.</p>

<h2>Automation on steroids</h2>

<p> is a cool new service that allows you to create little task automations. Based on the inputs from different services you are able to funnel data and manipulate it. It takes advantage of many web APIs and creates an easy to use interface. What I would like to see is an easier way to do automation and more complex automation. With an interface similar to Yahoo Pipes. You could drag services and "connect" them with pipes. Also being able to use boolean logic to make them look similar to add something similar to "AND" and "OR" gates on boolean logic would be cool.</p>
