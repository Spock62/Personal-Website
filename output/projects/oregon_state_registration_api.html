  <p>During the the 2011 school year I attended an engineering fair where they were showing projects the CS students had worked on. One of the projects was AI scheduler. This has been a project that is been laying around the CS department for a while and I wanted to see some outcome. So I was inspired and decided that I would write a library that worked effectivly as an API for the Oregon State Registration System.</p><p>I got to work using some of the python standard packages and wrote what was in essence a large library of screen scraping functions. The library worked similar to the way you would expect an API wrapper to work. This allowed you to manipulate and change classes.</p><p>Even though I put quiet a lot of work into this specific project it never gained any traction among the student programmers at OSU, and my interest in maintaining it waned.</p><p>Regardless I spent about 2 more months writing a frontend for the library to illustrate several points in how the registration process could be improved</p><p>I may come back to this project at some point, but repurpose the library using a sturdier library like mechanize and not rely soley on xpaths. Also I would have a server that spawns that would actually expose the classes as a restful API.</p><p>If you are an Oregon State student reading this and are interested in helping plase contact me.</p>
